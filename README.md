## Abstract

This report presents a detailed analysis of Ethernet and Wi-Fi performance within a Local Area Network (LAN) environment. Using tools like iperf3 and Wireshark, we conducted a series of experiments to compare the goodput over TCP and UDP protocols in various network scenarios: direct Ethernet connections, Wi-Fi connections, and a hybrid Ethernet-WiFi setup.

## Introduction

The primary objective of this lab was to quantify and compare the performance of Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections in a LAN setting. While the general superiority of Ethernet over Wi-Fi is well-known, our goal was to provide specific, measurable data on the performance differences in our particular setup. This analysis aims to offer practical insights for network design and optimization in real-world scenarios.
